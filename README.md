\nA web scraping project
Some links have pdfs embedded in them. If you need to download the files, it'd be rigorous to download the files one after the other, especially if they are many. 
\nThis code is supposed to check through the link (any link that has these pdfs you want) and help download and save the pdfs on your local machine all at once.
\nIt requests for the link in question and then you specify the path where you want these files to be stored on your local machine.
